# Processes-and-Threads--OperatingSystem

In this project I created Linux processes and threads and synchronize their executions. Beside synchronizing their executions, your processesand threads will only display few messages and then terminate.
The following concepts are presented:
  Process and Thread Naming Convention
  The process hierarchy
  Synchronizing threads from the same process
  Threads barrier
  Synchronizing threads from different processes
